# Operator provenance

Use these bounded rules when authenticated service metadata or a consequential decision could be mistaken for human authorization.

## Actor attribution

Asana/GitHub actor, author, creator, committer, or similar account fields prove attribution only. When agents/tools can act through Marco's account, those fields do not prove that Marco physically acted, approved, transferred ownership, or supplied a Review verdict. Agent-authored durable writes keep Dish Agent role/host provenance.

## Decision provenance

Keep explicit human decisions, standing repository policy, agent inference/recommendation, runtime observation, and authenticated-account metadata distinct. Consequential policy/product/cutover decisions require durable human provenance; runtime or attribution data never silently becomes such a decision.

## Execution-state truth

Describe only the strongest state proved for the exact current attempt. A durable handoff is not launch; launch invocation is not acceptance; acceptance is not RUNNING. Asana placement, branch/PR existence, leases, locks, or prior-attempt evidence do not prove current execution liveness. Attempt N evidence never proves attempt N+1. GitHub absence is categorical only after successful exhaustive open-PR enumeration and exact assignment reconciliation; otherwise report UNKNOWN rather than `no PR`.
